# FINDINGS — consolidated running log

One entry per established fact, WITH how it was discovered. Append new
findings at the bottom of the relevant section with a date. Refuted
hypotheses stay, marked SUPERSEDED.

CONSOLIDATION NOTE (2026-07-24): this file now merges TWO research
lines that ran in parallel from commit 6069d95:

- **[H2023]** — NA156 H2023 production line (this machine): settings
  evaluation, camera registry, zone aligns, within-zone growth,
  hardening cells U1–U20. Deep docs: `docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07.md`,
  `docs/merge-growth-strategy-2026-07.md`, `testing/ALIGN_MERGE_HARDENING_PLAN.md`.
- **[NA167 #n]** — NA167 H2075 merge-strategy matrix (Honeybadger box):
  strategies A/B/C, D-cell merge-mechanism isolation, findings #1–31.
  Deep docs: `testing/FINDINGS.md` (frozen numbered log, do not append),
  `testing/MERGE_STRATEGY_REPORT.md`, `testing/MERGE_TEST_PLAN.md`,
  `testing/NA167_SESSION_NOTES.md`.

Entries below carry their source tag. Cross-line reconciliations are
tagged **[RECON]** and dated 2026-07-24. `testing/FINDINGS.md` is
frozen as the NA167 raw log; all new findings go HERE.

## RealityScan 2.2 CLI behavior

- **addFolder does NOT recurse by default in this build** — zone_1/zone_2
  aligns added "0 layer images" and every flight-log row then failed
  err:18002. Discovered: live H2023 run failed in 25 s; RealityScan.log
  snapshot showed `Added 0 layer images`. Fix: `appIncSubdirs=true`
  before every addFolder. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
  - Nuance: an earlier NA167 zone_13 run DID import camera subfolders
    into one scene via -addFolder [NA167 #5] — that run had
    appIncSubdirs set by the fixed workflow; the flag, not the build,
    is the variable.
- **-align on instance defaults is a real hazard** — AlignImagesFromFolder
  never applied AlignmentParams.xml; only AlignZonesSequentially did.
  Discovered: code reading during settings evaluation. Fix: every
  workflow applies the sfm*/lis* keys; policy "never align on instance
  defaults". [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **cmd splits unquoted `;` `,` `=` into separate .bat arguments**, and
  Python subprocess only quotes on whitespace — `key=value` settings
  arrived split, RealityScan.log showed `Parsing setting key=value ...
  failed [err:7155]`, meaning **no flag cell had applied its flags** and
  the parse errors aborted workflows via the errors marker. Lists now
  cross as files, settings as `key:value`. [NA167 #15] (2026-07-23)
- **-align takes no parameters in 2.x** — `-align "%AlignmentParams%"`
  is not supported (allcommands.htm + online docs); settings must be
  applied via delegated `-set` commands before a plain `-align`.
  [H2023, first-machine validation] (2026-07-21)
- **-selectAllComponents does not exist in RealityScan 2.2** — fails
  0x82000060; only selectComponent / selectMaximalComponent (+
  selectComponentWithLeastReprojectionError) exist. The dead command
  had lived unnoticed in AlignZonesSequentially.bat. [NA167 #13]
  (2026-07-23)
- **exportLatestComponents exports ALL components of the last alignment**
  (gated by setMinComponentSize) — the old maximal-only export was
  unnecessary loss. Discovered: allcommands.htm sweep. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **-setMinComponentSize is deprecated in 2.2** ("will be removed in the
  next release") but still required — without it components under the
  default threshold 5 are silently excluded from selection/export.
  Discovered: warning line in a per-cell RealityScan.log snapshot.
  [NA167 #22] (2026-07-24)
- **-setFeatureSource 0|1|2 and -selectImage ARE CLI** — the
  merge feature-source trio was wrongly believed GUI-only. Discovered:
  allcommands.htm "Commands for Selected Images" section. [H2023]
  (2026-07-23)
- **selectImage matches LITERAL FULL PATHS ONLY in this build** — bare
  regexp, dot-star-wrapped, glob, and regexp with explicit 'set'
  modifier ALL silently select nothing; a literal full path selects
  exactly its image. Selection composition = per-image literal
  selectImage union loop (~0.1–0.3 s per image — budget minutes for
  thousand-image sets). The Help's "imagePath|regexp" wording does not
  match observed 2.2 behavior — forum-mining follow-up open.
  Discovered: bisection probes U-SEL2 through U-SEL8. [H2023, U1/U19/U2]
  (2026-07-23)
- **-editInputSelection is the master per-image CLI control** (local
  Help tutorials/editselectioncommand.htm): on the current image
  selection it sets enable-alignment (inpEnabled), features source
  (aligFeaturesMode 0|1|2), enable meshing/texturing, texture weight,
  masking mode, per-image PRIOR POSE (inpPose 0–3, translation/rotation,
  accuracies, locked-pose groups) AND full calibration/lens priors
  (inpCalibrationGroup, inpCalibration Unknown/Approximate/Fixed,
  inpFocal, principal point, inpDistortionModel 0–5, coefficients).
  `"inpEnabled=false"` works as a single quoted key=value arg, and
  -align honors enable/disable exactly. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **XMP export naming: the COMMAND determines it, not the scene** —
  `-exportXMP` writes STEM-named sidecars; `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent`
  writes ORDINAL sidecars (00000.xmp, …) in every observed context.
  Four consistent datapoints; an earlier session-based hypothesis was
  WRONG and is SUPERSEDED. Consequence: per-component membership is
  derived by SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENCE of `-exportXMP` stem harvests as
  components are deleted (AlignZone.bat identity loop). [H2023, B10
  final form] (2026-07-23)
- **Flight-log import leaves the matched images ACTIVELY SELECTED**, and
  selection-driven exports under -silent then export nothing
  ("Export Selection" dialog auto-answered; XMP export completed in
  0.057 s vs 20.5 s). Fix: -deselectAllImages before exports. [H2023]
  (2026-07-23)
- **-importFlightLog reports a failed process (err:18002, 0x820000FF)
  when the log references images not in the scene** — the trajectory
  itself imports fine. Filter the flight log to images present when
  aligning subsets. [H2023, first-machine validation] (2026-07-21)
- **-importComponent of a relocated .rsalign hangs forever** (#timeout
  state, no error; observed 6 h). In-place imports: ~2 s per 0.7 GB.
  Import components from their original export paths — `.complist`
  workflow input exists for exactly this. [NA167 #11] (2026-07-23)
- **The errors marker carries only ErrorWriter's numeric result code**,
  never the err:NNNN text (that is only in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\
  RealityScan.log, truncated each boot). Tolerant handlers must match
  codes (2181038335 = 0x820000FF warning-class; 0x80070057 E_INVALIDARG
  from emptied-scene select paths). [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **0x8000FFFF is generic ("unexpected program state")** — broken -set
  args and the zone_14 align failure emitted the identical code; and
  RealityScan.log is truncated on every instance boot, so post-failure
  snapshots lose the race to the next boot. Log copies must happen
  inside the driver immediately after the failing call returns.
  [NA167 #16] (2026-07-23)
- **-getStatus says "gone" before the process releases marker-file
  handles** — the next workflow's marker clear raced the teardown;
  60 s per-file retry added. [NA167 #14] (2026-07-23)
- **Process result code 1 is benign in practice** — routine successful
  operations (e.g. -addFolder) report result 1 through the trigger;
  real failures report distinct codes. Whitelist of 0/1 kept. [H2023,
  first-machine validation] (2026-07-21)
- **RealityScan 2.2 emits periodic internal heartbeat processes through
  the same appProcessExecCmd trigger** — "the results log grew" does not
  mean "our command finished"; completion = delegate → grace → double
  -waitCompleted. [H2023, first-machine validation] (2026-07-21)
- **Check Integrity / Check Topology have no CLI commands** — their fix
  action maps to -cleanModel + -closeHoles. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **-removeSelectedTriangles removes the SELECTED set** (= Filter
  Selection tool); -selectLargeTrianglesRel threshold is multiples of
  average edge length, not pixels. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **-deleteSelectedComponent, -deleteComponent <idx>, and
  -deleteAllComponents all exist** in this build (allcommands.htm sweep).
  [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **selectMaximalComponent / renameSelectedComponent /
  deleteSelectedComponent silently no-op on an empty scene** (no errors
  marker) — loop terminals must be file-existence checks, not error
  checks. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **quit-without-save leaves the .rsproj bundle byte-stable** across
  load/delete/export cycles (hash-verified twice); rename →
  exportSelectedComponentDir writes <newname>.rsalign. [H2023, U15/U16]
  (2026-07-23)
- **-exportRegistration without a params XML blocks forever headless** —
  avoid until a params file saved from the GUI dialog exists. [H2023]
  (2026-07-21)
- **#timeout progress lines defeat line-change stall detection** (every
  tick differs, so a hang counts as activity) — AND #timeout does NOT
  always mean hung: heavy align phases legitimately freeze the progress
  fraction 20+ min (40 #timeout lines in a successful 94.6% run). The
  pathological signature is #timeout from fraction 0.00 with ever-growing
  ETA. Policy: stall-warn on #timeout (2 h), never auto-kill an align on
  it. [NA167 #12, #28] (2026-07-23/24)

## Alignment behavior & settings

- **Settings for the WCA rig class** (full rationale:
  docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07.md §4): sfmEnableCameraPrior=true
  (IS the GUI "use camera priors for georeferencing"), prior weight
  10.0, sfmDistortionModel Brown3 global fallback with REAL models per
  camera via XMP (fisheye=division, rectilinear=brown3, post-merge
  upgrade path Brown4WithTangential2), sfmDetectorSensitivity Ultra,
  sfmImagesOverlap Low→Medium, sfmForceComponentRematch=false and
  sfmMergeGeoreferencedComponents=false for pass-1 zone aligns,
  appIncSubdirs=true always. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **XMP calibration sidecars are the ONLY way to separate EXIF-identical
  cameras** — WCA rendered JPGs are EXIF-identical across cameras (Z CAM
  E2-F6, no focal tag). One calibration/lens group per PHYSICAL camera.
  Old batcher values (camlower "12 mm fisheye"; actually rectilinear
  17 mm) were wrong and plausibly explain NA167's "priors hurt" A/B.
  [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **XMP calibration priors were never loaded in any historical run** —
  written as `image.jpg.xmp`; RealityScan only reads `image.xmp`.
  Discovered by an arithmetic anomaly in sidecar counts after aligning
  zone_13. [NA167 #3] (2026-07-22)
- **The old prior CONTENT itself hurt registration (96.3% → 89.6% on
  Zeuss)** — A/B on zone_13 with priors absent vs promoted. Generation
  is opt-in until corrected per-camera values are re-validated per rig.
  [NA167 #4] (2026-07-22)
- **Extracted frames were timestamped one output interval early** (60 s
  at 1 fpm) — frame seek and timestamp source used different frame
  indices; confirmed with a synthetic per-frame-gray video. Any dataset
  extracted with the old __extract_video_cv2 carries the offset.
  [NA167 #1] (2026-07-22)
- **UTM zone must be derived per cruise, never hand-edited** —
  FlightLogParams.xml is auto-generated from the zone tag in the
  flight-log filename (NA173 was 57S while the template said 4N; NA167
  computed 53N and round-tripped). [NA167 #6 + H2023] (2026-07-22)
- **Alignment fragmentation is strongly nondeterministic; total
  registration is not** — zone_1 (4,540 images, identical settings,
  sidecars, inputs) aligned to 2 components/4,391 cameras in one run and
  9 components/4,392 in another. Component structure cannot be relied on
  across runs — only manifest-tracked image sets can — and within-zone
  growth/merge is MANDATORY machinery. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Alignment runtime varies ~3× with scene character at equal image
  count** (zone_6 61.6/97.8 min vs zone_4 24.3/20.8 min, both ~1.5k
  frames, same GPU, both run twice) — budget by zone, not image count.
  [NA167 #20] (2026-07-23)
- **zone_14 fails standalone alignment deterministically (4/4) with
  fully clean data** — RealityScan internal error MSS_STR001 in the
  reconstruction phase (forensic log: testing/results/z14_forensic_rslog.txt);
  data exonerated by full-pixel decode, MD5, Laplacian, nav checks.
  Its images align FINE inside a larger scene (B grew through it at
  94.6%). Production rule: when a zone fails alignment solo, grow it
  from an aligned neighbor — don't retry solo. Reportable to Epic with
  the captured log. [NA167 #17, #18, #27] (2026-07-23/24)
- **Align output is never pose-stable** — a free re-align moved ALL 118
  cameras of a solved smoke scene and can drop 1–2 marginal ones.
  [H2023, U18 bonus] (2026-07-23)
- **Pose-locking is unusable as a growth anchor** — editInputSelection
  inpPose=3 takes effect but -align then refuses: "prior set to 'Exact'
  mode must be all aligned in a single run. Incremental adding is not
  supported." Checkpoint/rollback stays the primary never-shrink
  mechanism. [H2023, U18 FAIL] (2026-07-23)

## Merge & component growth

### Mechanism (reconciled 2026-07-24)

- **[RECON] Shared cameras are the ONLY merge mechanism verified to work
  headless.** NA167 D-cell isolation: zero-shared-camera pairs NEVER
  fuse — under -mergeComponents or -align-as-merge, georef flag on or
  off, rematch on or off, duplicate-path or shared-path form — and the
  non-merge is always SILENT (workflow exits success; the "merged"
  export is just the biggest input). With shared cameras,
  -mergeComponents FUSES: D6 split-zone fixture (two zone_6 halves
  sharing 390 images, aligned solo to 749 + 342 cams) merged in 56 min
  of real reconstruction ending "Finalizing 1 component". Verify EVERY
  merge by pose-XMP camera census, never exit status. [NA167 #23–26,
  #30, #31] (2026-07-24)
- **[RECON] Camera identity is (at minimum) path identity** — zones
  built as per-zone COPIES of overlap images (different paths) provide
  no shared-camera identity for merging; zones must reference a common
  image pool (imagelists or same on-disk paths). This makes the
  batcher's duplicate-copy output a production defect for the merge
  stage (change queued). [NA167, MERGE_STRATEGY_REPORT] (2026-07-24)
- **[RECON] OPEN CONTRADICTION (test cell D7, testing/MERGE_TEST_PLAN.md):
  the H2023/NA156 line observed apparent fusion WITHOUT path identity,
  twice** — smoke: mini_a (118) + mini_b (62), 40 overlap images
  duplicated at different paths, merge_zones.py produced one 180-camera
  component in 66 s; production H2023: 5 duplicate-path components
  fused to a 3,860-camera maximal in 31 min. NA167 D1/D2 say the georef
  flag never does this. Candidate discriminator: merge_zones.py imports
  the union flight log + CRS into the merge scene and runs `-update` —
  the D-cells never gave the merge scene its own constraints. Suspicion:
  180 = 118 + 62 exactly (no dedup of the 40 duplicated images), which
  is consistent with rigid side-by-side PLACEMENT rather than identity
  fusion — seam quality unverified. Until D7 runs, treat georef-based
  merging as UNPROVEN and duplicate-path "fusions" as suspect placements.
  (2026-07-24)
- **[RECON] "Merge Components is rigid best-fit" needs qualification.**
  The Epic staff claim (2021, pre-rename, outside the 4-year trust
  window) says no re-optimization / no repositioning / no new images.
  Empirically: with shared cameras -mergeComponents runs ~56 min of
  visible "merge reconstruction" and can finalize different component
  counts [NA167 #30–31]; and H2023 zone_1's final census read +37
  cameras vs the manifest baseline after a rigid-merge stage was the
  only accepted mutation (attribution unresolved — merge effect vs
  census-mapping nuance). What stands: merge cannot shrink and cannot
  register orphans. What is UNVERIFIED: "no re-optimization" in the
  current build. (2026-07-24)
- **featureSource is consumed by ALIGN, not Merge Components**: 0 =
  merge using overlaps (images COMMON to components — NOTE per the
  identity finding this means shared-PATH images, not duplicate
  copies), 1 = component features (existing tie points only), 2 = all
  image features (slow, small counts). Discovered: components.htm
  "Features source" prose. [H2023, caveat added at RECON] (2026-07-23)
- **Align is the actual merge/growth engine**: re-runs use "special
  algorithms designed for merging components", are cheap (cached
  features), "try a different strategy" on repetition; after
  georeferencing, align hunts additional cross-component tie points.
  Discovered: mergecomponents*.htm tutorials + staff answer. — BUT
  align-as-merge ALSO requires shared cameras across components
  [NA167 D3]. [H2023 + RECON caveat] (2026-07-23/24)
- **Align can SHRINK components** (re-optimization drops marginal
  cameras) — "grow, never shrink" must be enforced by checkpoint/
  rollback, not assumed. Observed: H2023 3,860 → 3,855; zone_1 c7 pass
  lost 51 previously-registered images. [H2023] (2026-07-23/24)
- **A merged component is NOT georeferenced unless the merge scene holds
  constraints** — imported components' own georeferencing does not carry
  into the new component. Fix: union flight log + CRS params into the
  merge scene, then `-update`. Discovered: owner GUI inspection
  ("showstopper") + allcommands.htm + live re-run. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **Component reimport does NOT carry non-member images** — orphans are
  absent from a components-only project and carry no trajectory until
  the flight log is imported. Checkpoint/rollback must use .rsproj file
  copies, not component reimport. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **Official fix-and-reimport round trip**: export faulty part →
  fix in spare scene → reimport → align "applies fixes". Components
  tolerate duplicate images by design. [H2023, components.htm] (2026-07-23)

### Strategy results (NA167 zones 6/14/4 matrix + H2023 production)

- **Sequential growth (B) and joint align (C) give identical quality;
  they differ 2.6× in time and 2.7× in memory, opposite winners** —
  B: one component, 3,906/4,131 (94.6%), 444 min, ≤60 GB. C: one
  component, 3,904 (94.5%), 169 min, ~165 GB peak. Joint alignment
  extrapolates to ~700 GB for a 19k-image dive — chunking is mandatory
  at production scale. [NA167 #19] (2026-07-24)
- **Incremental growth is state-sensitive and can DEGRADE existing
  structure** — z6→z14 two-zone grow fragmented to an 870-camera
  maximal (< z6's solo 1,533) while the three-zone B grow through the
  same stages held 3,906. Growth outcomes are not order/subset-
  invariant — verify camera counts after every grow step. [NA167 #29]
  (2026-07-24)
- **Empirical H2023 registration**: zone_1 96.7% (4,391/4,540) first
  run, 4,392 re-run; zone_2 94.3–95.1% (920–928/976); cross-zone merge
  produced a 3,860-camera maximal (83.9% of unique) in 31 min (see
  OPEN CONTRADICTION for mechanism). Registration ceiling is
  unregistrable imagery, not merge mechanics. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **Twin components across zones**: the 20% batcher overlap duplicates
  images into both zones; the same strip solved independently can
  fragment into near-identical twins whose residual quality differs
  with solve context. Post--update residuals expose the weak twin. A
  twin with no unique images is discardable by the "never discard
  unique images" rule. Detection/automation: modules/component_analysis.py
  (containment scan, keeper choice, border gating, orphan tracking,
  merge planning; 31-test pytest suite passing). Coverage is checked
  against the UNION of still-kept group members, worst-first. [H2023]
  (2026-07-23)
- **Georef-only rigid fusion** (sfmMergeGeoreferencedComponents +
  merge/-update) was DESIGNED as the last resort placing components
  purely by nav (~1–2 m real accuracy, bakes nav error into seams) —
  but see the OPEN CONTRADICTION: it has never been PROVEN to act
  headless at all. [H2023 design + NA167 negative results] (2026-07-23/24)
- **Growth passes are align-UPDATES that refresh EVERY component** — a
  census after an "isolated" component pass covers the whole zone;
  per-component before/after accounting produced phantom gains. The
  zone-level baseline census drives the invariant, gain, and orphan
  derivation. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Zone_2 growth ground truth**: 928/976 (95.1%), ZERO real gains —
  the 48 orphans are genuinely unregistrable; honest convergence after
  one sweep. Three components remain by design (northern strip has no
  visual ties). [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Zone_1 growth ground truth: EVERY re-solve pass shrinks a
  weakly-connected fragment set** — global re-align + all 8 component
  passes rejected and rolled back (c7's pass lost 51 images); final
  4,429/4,540 (97.6%), 148 orphans. The +37 delta vs the 4,392 manifest
  baseline is an OPEN question (rigid merge was the only accepted
  mutation). Implication: for fragmentation like zone_1's, visual
  growth is exhausted immediately; the cross-zone stage is the
  productive path. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Checkpoint/rollback validated in anger** — a growth run killed
  mid-pass was fully recovered by copying the "initial" .rsproj bundle
  checkpoint back over the scene. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **In-session successive-difference identity capture VALIDATED end to
  end** (smoke mini_a): align → saves → destructive harvest loop →
  quit-no-save produced .rsalign + manifest (118 members by real
  basename, UTM bbox), census from manifests == original registration,
  zero pose sidecars left beside images. [H2023] (2026-07-23)

## Resource envelope & monitoring

- **Near-OOM, RealityScan slows to a crawl WITHOUT crashing and WITHOUT
  spilling to NVMe** — indistinguishable in the progress feed from a
  hang, making memory pressure the THIRD cause of persistent #timeout.
  Mitigation: RealityScanCLI samples available RAM (GlobalMemoryStatusEx),
  warns below 4 GB free, includes the RAM figure in stall warnings.
  MEASUREMENT CAVEAT (owner-caught): workflows run MULTIPLE
  RealityScan.exe processes (persistent instance + transient helpers) —
  identify the instance by largest working set or tracked PID before
  quoting memory numbers (a "2.2 GB during a 4,540-image align" misread
  was a 30 MB transient; the instance was ~11 GB + 4 GB VRAM).
  Processing box: 93.6 GB RAM. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Memory bounds observed**: per-zone aligns ≤ ~60 GB (NA167 ~1.5k
  images/zone); joint 4,131-image align ~165 GB peak on a 192 GB box.
  [NA167 #19] (2026-07-24)

## Rig & data

- **H2023 contains TWO discrete physical features — the bow and the
  main hull of the wreck, surveyed as separate chunks in one dive**
  (owner-stated 2026-07-24). Zones are batched on image DENSITY, not
  features, so zone boundaries are blind to feature boundaries; a
  discrete feature's component may simply be smaller than the main
  hull's and can NEVER fuse with it visually. Consequences (owner
  intent, governs all component handling): a multi-component terminal
  state is a CORRECT outcome; "as big as it can get" is judged
  PER FEATURE, not per scene; no deletion/export/success logic may be
  size-based — only containment-based (no unique images) deletion is
  ever legal; a maximal-fraction success target misreads disjoint
  features as merge failure. Expect this pattern in other dives.
  [H2023, owner] (2026-07-24)
- **Four physical cameras** (owner-confirmed): Zeuss rect 23 mm; Port
  (aka cammid) fisheye 14 mm; Cinema (aka camlower) rect 17 mm;
  Starboard (aka camupper) fisheye 14 mm. NA156 mounts: Port 0 deg,
  1 m fwd + 1 m down; Cinema 45 deg down, 1 m fwd. S231C*.mov videos on
  D:\H2023 ARE Starboard (excluded for photogrammetry). [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **ROVDataConcat**: georeferencers require stage-2 kalman columns
  (final_datatable.csv); H2023 nav covers 2023-11-03T19:44 to
  2023-11-04T05:48; H2023 has no geotiff (kalman_offset fails, harmless
  for photogrammetry). Multiple nav CSVs per dive collide into one dict
  key — find_rov_datafiles prefers *final_datatable.csv [NA167 #9].
  [H2023 + NA167] (2026-07-23)
- **Full-file image verification is untenable at scale** — PIL
  .verify() ≈ 720 GB of reads over 18k stills; header-probe cut the
  stage to ~5 min. [NA167 #7] (2026-07-22)
- **CLAHE preprocessing: scope is EMPIRICALLY CONTESTED** — zone_9
  (NA173): baseline aligns to NOTHING, CLAHE 2.0/8×8 rescues it
  (validated default-on here). LilyJean stereo pairs (COLMAP pipeline,
  3,607 pairs): both adaptive enhancement and fixed backscatter
  subtraction REDUCED registration ~30% vs originals. Both results are
  real; scope unresolved; reconciliation matrix Q-05 queued (zone_9 ×
  COLMAP, LilyJean × RealityScan, judged on REGISTRATION). If CLAHE
  ends up texture-only, RealityScan Image Layers
  (.geometry/.texture/.mask) are the official reconciling mechanism.
  See docs/COLMAP_CROSSOVER.md. [H2023 + LilyJean fact base via
  HANDOFF] (2026-07-23)
  - UPDATE 2026-07-24: full COLMAP fact base received from owner
    (frozen copy docs/COLMAP_FINDINGS_UNIFIED.md). Its candidate
    explanations for the conflict (F-20260723-33): ENGINE (RealityScan
    applies internal tone mapping pre-detection), DETECTOR, or IMAGERY
    REGIME (zone_9 baseline catastrophically flat vs LilyJean baseline
    that aligns well). Also externally corroborated on the COLMAP side
    (Summers & Jones, arXiv:2507.21715: enhancement generally degrades
    feature matching; raw preferred). Their standing policy — geometry
    on originals, color-correct only at texturing — is the opposite of
    this pipeline's default; Q-05's four cells decide the
    documentation-guide policy for both.
- **Cross-engine Zeuss-camera anomaly** — COLMAP zone_9: 710 zeuss
  frames REGISTERED but with ZERO triangulated points (contribute
  nothing downstream; C-20260721-15/Q-07 in the COLMAP fact base) —
  independently echoing this line's NA167 zone_13 A/B where XMP priors
  cost 6.7 points of registration specifically on Zeuss [NA167 #4].
  Two engines, two failure shapes, one physical camera family: treat
  Zeuss calibration/imagery as suspect and prioritize per-camera
  validation when Zeuss zones underperform. [RECON, via COLMAP fact
  base] (2026-07-24)

## Windows & automation traps

- **cmd: exit /b N inside a MULTI-STATEMENT parenthesized block returns
  0 to the caller**; the single-line `( echo msg & exit /b 1 )` form
  propagates correctly. Never put exit /b inside multi-line parens; use
  single-line chains or goto. [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **cmd label-search fails on LF-only line endings** — "cannot find the
  batch label" strikes intermittently at LF-only byte offsets, even
  after earlier `call :label` calls in the same file succeeded. All
  .bat/.vbs must be CRLF; .gitattributes pins *.bat and *.vbs eol=crlf;
  normalize after any scripted edit. [H2023 + NA167 #21, independently
  hit on BOTH machines] (2026-07-23)
- **Git Bash mangles cmd switches** — `cmd /c foo.bat` under MSYS
  converts /c to C:\ and launches an interactive cmd that exits 0
  silently. Use `cmd //c` or PowerShell for .bat invocation tests.
  [H2023] (2026-07-23)
- **VBS quote-escaping in string literals is a trap — compose with
  Chr(34)** — CRITICAL SELF-INFLICTED: malformed ErrorWriterLaunch.vbs
  quoting meant ErrorWriter.bat NEVER RAN and the errors-marker system
  was inert for ~a day of runs (caught by review; completed results
  remained trustworthy because they were validated by census/manifest
  data). Diagnostic: the hook fires for every completed process incl.
  heartbeats, so an active progress file WITHOUT a results log is proof
  the hook is dead. After ANY hook-chain change, verify
  results_<inst>.log grows during the next run. [H2023] (2026-07-24)
- **Unattended prompts must catch EOFError, not trust isatty()** —
  hidden consoles report isatty()=True with an EOF stdin. [H2023]
  (2026-07-24)
- **cmd/stdin encoding breaks scripted prompts** — PowerShell native
  piping prepends a BOM and delivers CRLF (`input()` returned "a\r").
  .strip() everywhere; scripted input() in drivers. [NA167 #10]
  (2026-07-22)
- **ASCII-only console output everywhere** (cp1252 crashes; hit twice).
  PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 when parsing UTF-8 sources. [both lines]
- **One-off cmd anomaly, unexplained**: after D6's 56-min merge block,
  `%RealityScan%` expanded empty ("'-delegateTo' is not recognized") —
  single occurrence across ~10 identical workflows; the export step
  died. Watch for recurrence. [NA167 #31 note] (2026-07-24)

## Process conventions

- RC_projects daily save schema: {expedition_dive}_{zone|merged}_YYYYMMDD
  .rsproj in RC_projects one level up from the zone image directory;
  saves after components / merge / texture / final model. (owner
  requirement 2026-07-23)
- Model recipe (owner 2026-07-23): high → remove marginal → remove
  large(30) → largest component → closeHoles+clean → simplify(noise)
  → texture → 4× simplify(smooth 80%)+clean → unwrap → reproject.
  Keep: raw high, textured pre-simplify, textured post-simplify.
  Texture AFTER closeHoles so fill areas get blended image color;
  reprojection then maps manifold→manifold (no nodata).
- Never run RealityScan headless for owner-attended runs: RS_HEADLESS=0.
- Verify merges/grows by camera census, never exit status (multiple
  silent-failure modes are on record: silent non-merge, silent no-op
  selects, inert error hook).
- Forum-mining rules (owner directive 2026-07-23): staff replies
  outrank user lore; only posts ≤4 years old trusted; pre-rename
  (RealityCapture-era) posts get most suspicion; every adopted gem goes
  here with URL, author status, date, verification status.
